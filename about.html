                Silat Seni Gayong was established by the late Dato Meor Abdul Rahman bin Daeng Uda Mohd Hashim DPCM. 
                When he was 19, the Sultan of Perak, the late Sultan Alang Iskandar, appointed him 'Panglima Sendo Perak'.
                He received the 'King George VI' medal in 1947 in recognition of his exceptional work with the Singapore 
                Criminal Investigation Department (C.I.D.). He is the great-grandson of the Panglima Hitam, also known as Daing Kuning.
            <br>
            <br>
                At the age of twelve, the late Dato' Meor began receiving all of the wisdom and pointers of Silat Seni Gayong from his grandpa 
                (on his mother's side), Syed Zainal Al-Attas, a well-known Hulubalang in Pahang. On October 22, 1963, Silat Seni Gayong was 
                officially registered as an organisation in Johor Bahru. It has registration number 361 and is known as PERTUBUHAN SILAT SENI 
                GAYONG MALAYSIA (PSSGM). Together with the late Dato' Onn Jaafar, the late Dato' Meor worked on the registration. In 1997, the 
                Ministry of Youth and Sports reorganised martial arts organisations, which prompted PSSGM's leadership to re-register the organisation under the 
                Sports Development Act. In 1998, PSSGM was legally registered with the Malaysian Sports Commissioner. PSSGM has also established itself in many
                Institutes of Public Studies (IPTA) such as UM, UKM, UTM, UPM, UIA, UITM and so on.
            <br>
            <br>
                Gayong Silat study is based on physical training as well as the application of martial discipline elements and ethics in order to generate 
                good and beneficial martial artists. This martial art's primary objective is to spread Malay martial arts for the good of the nation, race, and religion. 
                In order to create intelligent and polite individuals, martial arts must be used to instill self-identity, unity, and discipline.
            <br>
            <br>
                On June 23, 1991, Dato' Meor Abdul Rahman returned to Rahmatullah. He passed away on the lap of his adored uncle and heir, Puan Siti Kalsom,
                at a specialist hospital in Ipoh, Perak.
